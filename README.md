## TIC TAC BRO

This Tic Tac Toe version was created by Chris Purcell for WDI10 Project 0.

# FEATURES

The game starts off with a blank screen & a query as too whether the user would like to play against a computer. 
Once this is clicked the choice of "X" or "O" appears, & once chosen the game board shows itself & the game begins.
This game has an AI included. The two player version is available at a different location.
The AI can be beaten if player goes first & selects middle, side, corner, it is able to win in this way.
