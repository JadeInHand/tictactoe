## TIC TAC BRO

This Tic Tac Toe version was created by Chris Purcell for WDI10 Project 0.

# FEATURES

The game starts off with a blank screen with a single button  query as too whether the user would like to play against a computer. 
Once this is clicked the choice of "X" or "O" appears, & once chosen the game board shows itself & the game begins.
This game has an AI included. The two player version is available at a different location through the link in-game.

# BUGS

Sometimes the game doesn't verify win, lose or draw & just sits there. This is highly inconsistent & was unable to debug.

# THANKS

- Basic Tic Tac Toe game, with both single and multiplayer. AI seems unbeatable to me. Try him out and let me know.


# BUGS

- When reseting the board using the reset button (only happens midgame), causes future draws to not be properly recorded until another winner emerges then seems to go back to normal from there.
- You tell me! Raise an issue or submit a pull request and I'll take a look.
- Let me know any good ways to refactor my code.

# THANKS

- Joel, Jack & Mike from General Assembly, Sydney.
- My classmates and friends
