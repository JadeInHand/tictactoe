## TIC TAC BRO

This Tic Tac Toe version was created by Chris Purcell for WDI10 Project 0.

# FEATURES

The game starts off with a blank screen with a single button  query as too whether the user would like to play against a computer. 
Once this is clicked the choice of "X" or "O" appears, & once chosen the game board shows itself & the game begins.
This game has an AI included. The two player version is available at a different location through the link in-game.

# BUGS

Sometimes the game doesn't verify win, lose or draw & just sits there. This is highly inconsistent & was unable to debug.
