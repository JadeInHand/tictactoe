## TIC TAC BRO

This Tic Tac Toe version was created by Chris Purcell for WDI10 Project 0.

# FEATURES

- Basic Tic Tac Toe game, with both single and multiplayer. AI seems unbeatable to me. Try him out and let me know.


# BUGS

- When reseting the board using the reset button (only happens midgame), causes future draws to not be properly recorded until another winner emerges then seems to go back to normal from there.
- You tell me! Raise an issue or submit a pull request and I'll take a look.
- Let me know any good ways to refactor my code.

# THANKS

# TO DO

- Intergrate Single and Multiplayer.
